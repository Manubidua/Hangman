# Hangman Game

The Hangman Game is a classic word-guessing game where the player attempts to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters one at a time. The game provides a random word to guess, and the player has a limited number of incorrect attempts before they lose. The player's progress is displayed as they correctly guess letters, and the game ends when the player either guesses the word or runs out of attempts. This text-based implementation of Hangman is a simple and interactive way to enjoy this traditional word game.
